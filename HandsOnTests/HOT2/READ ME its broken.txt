Not sure if you will read this, but I am turning this in in a broken state unfortunately. For the life of me, I could not get the application to add new products or update current ones, and I fear I may have overcomplicated this to the point that it is a big mess. I also couldn't figure out how to get the category names to appear on the list. I am turning this in broken because I am behind on school work this week and need to start working on the other assignments ASAP so I will take whatever point deductions this results in.
